jQuery-Simple-Pub-Sub
=====================

A simple publication/subscription model - wrapped by an experimental learning model

My goal is to create a lightweight modular system that makes it easy to extend 
the functionality of a plugin by providing a custom event model and ways to 
call the custom events on subscribers in response to custom events on the publishers. 

But to be honest, this is more about learning the logic behind the programming than it is about
just getting this project done. 

Though there are other pubSubs out there, they seem limited in scope and particular in nature.

Your help is requested in developing this system as a means of exploring jquery, event modeling, 
pubsub services, and general javascript programming techniques. So, rather than provide feedback
that suggests that this proeject is not worthwhile, please particpate with this thought in mind

<b> enlightenment is not the destination of this project, but rather it is the path</b>

That is to say that this project will hopefully document the decision process and development
cycle that goes into creating this kind of system. If you see a better way to approach something
or if you think that that something is not needed, please feel free to say something.

If you would be willing to explain why a different approach would be better or to even explain
the current preferred way of developing a pub/sub system, that would be great.

If you could write this plugin in your sleep and can't be bothered to provide guidance along the
way, please just keep it to yourself rather than discourage us from learning hands on.

Sorry if I sound a little preachy, but a little tolerance is a good thing when folks, like myself,
are just learning.
